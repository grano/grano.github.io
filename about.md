Hey there, I'm Andy. I'm a Googler, musician, golfer, hiker, and traveler.

Most of the time, you can find me working on Google Analytics (or talking about it).

I'm a jazz and klezmer pianist, keyboardist, and composer. I occasionally post music to the blog, or if you want to hear me live, check out the Klezmer band I play in: [Boyz II Mensch](http://www.boyziimensch.com).

This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/grano/grano.github.io).

I use Google Analytics on this website. If you would not like to be tracked, use the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

The views expressed on this website are my own and may or may not reflect those of my employer.

Thanks for stopping by. Have a look around. I'd be happy to hear from you. (<andy.granowitz@gmail.com>)
