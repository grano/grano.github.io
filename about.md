Hey there, I'm Andy. I'm a Googler, musician, golfer, hiker, and traveler.

Most of the time, you can find me working on Google Analytics (or talking about it).

I'm a jazz and klezmer pianist, keyboardist, and composer. I occasionally post music to the blog, or if you want to hear me live, check out the Klezmer band I play in: [Boyz II Mensch](http://www.boyziimensch.com).

Thanks for stopping by. Have a look around. I'd be happy to hear from you. (<andy.granowitz@gmail.com>)
