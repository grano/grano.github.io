My process for buying a keyboard looked like this:

1. Think about needs and do research
2. Go to a few stores and try the keyboards
3. Do final research, look online for pricing, and purchase

For step 2, it is important to make sure you like the feel, sound, and potentially the look of the keyboard. The only way to really know is to try it in person. For researching in steps 1 and 3, there are many good resources out there, but one of the best is [pianobuyer.com](http://www.pianobuyer.com/).

For step 1, here are the main things I thought about when buying my keyboard:

- What is your price range?
- Will you be transporting it, or mostly keeping it one location?
- Do you need all 88 keys?
- Do you want a realistic feel (weighted keys)?
- Do you want a realistic piano sound?
- Do you want other sounds?
- Will you be utilizing the built in speakers, or will you be using an amp or headphones?

Let's walk through each question.

####Price

In order to get a frame of reference, browse a music store and see how much keyboards cost. Low end will be a few hundred dollars, high end a few thousand. I had about $500 to spend, which is sufficient to get a basic quality keyboard. 

####Ease of Transport

This will be a function of your ability to carry around a keyboard and how often you will need to transport it. For me, I wanted the ability to easily move my keyboard if needed, but I knew it wouldn't be happening every day. So I needed to be able to carry it myself, but that is all. Most keyboards I was considering met this criteria.

####88 Keys

For me, I had to have 88 keys. Unless you are a very new beginner or severely space or price limited, I would recommend 88 keys.

####Realistic Feel

How similar to an acoustic piano a given keyboard feels is a spectrum. Generally, the more realistic, the more expensive. This was one of the more important features for me.

####Realistic Sound

Similarly, having the keyboard sound similar to an acoustic piano is a spectrum. This was also very important to me when I was buying my keyboard.

####Other Sounds

Many keyboards come with lots of non-piano sounds. They can be fun to play, but this was less of a priority for me.

####Built-in Speakers

I wanted the speakers to be loud enough to fill a room. For playing with a band, I think most of the time you'll want to use an amp. To use an amp, you'll need input for a quarter inch jack (or a more complicated setup). With a cheap converter, this input can also be used to plug in headphones as well. I thought having this input was standard, but some keyboards do not have one. Double check.

Similar to the quarter inch jack, I wouldn't buy a keyboard that does not have MIDI in and out. This should be standard, but worth double checking.

Ultimately, I bought the Yamaha P95. I was optimizing for sound quality, realistic feel, and price. In retrospect, I wouldn't mind better speakers and a few more bells and whistles, like more sounds. But overall I am pretty happy with it.

I also bought a stand, which I bring with me on gigs (I've become more conscience of seat and piano height). A good pair of headphones is also a good investment if you live with roommates or in close proximity to neighbors.
