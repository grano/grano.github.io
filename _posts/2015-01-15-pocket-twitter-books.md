Twiter is my primary source of news discovery. And [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) is my primary news consumption app.

When I have a few minutes to spare, I peruse Twitter for interesting articles that I want to read [[1]](#1). When I find one, I save it to Pocket. In addition to Twitter, I'll save articles to Pocket that friends or coworkers email to me, that I find when browsing news websites directly, that are linked to from other articles, etc.

When I have more than a few minutes, I will open up Pocket and read articles I've saved. 

This workflow separates content discovery and consumption, and is more productive for me than doing both at once. If I sit down to read articles in Pocket, I can get through many in a short period of time. No waiting for articles to load, no back and forth between apps. Focused, concentrated reading time. 

When I first began using Pocket, I was pleased with the increase in reading output. I felt myself reading more "long form" and getting deeper into topics.

In fact, I've become such an active Pocket user that at the end of 2014, I received an email from Pocket informing me that I was in the top 1% of readers.

That's right, I read 1.6 million words, which Pocket has calculated is about 35 books [[2]](#2). 

I was initially happy to see this. It confirmed my feeling that I was reading more using Pocket, which I thought of as a good thing. I still think so, but frankly I would rather have read 35 books! Or at least gone half and half.

A friend pointed out the irony that Pocket, despite being an app for reading digital content, still gives books the high merit of the benchmark. Can you imagine finishing a book and on the last page reading, "Awesome! You just read the equivalent of 500 news articles!"

Also ironically, Pocket's congratulatory note may end up backfiring. It was a bit of a wakeup call - read more books, less news articles. There is a tradeoff, as I enjoy being up on current events. But books allow you to go even deeper, and provide continuity from one reading session to the next (among *many* other benefits, of course). In 2015, I may look to convert some of those 35 "books" I read into actual books.


Footnotes:

<p id="1">[1] Naturally, whom I follow on Twitter has a large impact on the news I am consuming. Therefore, I do spend some time curating the list of whom I follow. One of the reasons I like Twitter is because my feed is a unique blend of my various unrelated interests - something you cannot get from traditional media.</p>
<p id="2">[2] That comes out to 46,694 words per book. On the short side, but otherwise seems like an okay assumption.</p>
