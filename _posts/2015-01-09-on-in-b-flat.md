Things I like about In B Flat:

- It allows you as the consumer of the experience to also be a part of the creation of the experience
- Because of that, it can be different each time
- Listening to it, you feel many different people coming together

And probably most of all, I enjoy the music that it produces. In B Flat is a tribute to [Terry Riley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley), composer of [In C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C) (see [In B Flat FAQs](http://www.inbflat.net/faq.html)). In C is also a very interesting concept, but the music doesnâ€™t make me feel the connections between the musicians in the same way as In B Flat does. 

In B Flat is inspirational to me, in that I would love to see more opportunities for musicians from around the world come together to collaboratively make music over the internet.
