I received Think Like a Freak, the third book in the Freakonomics series (following Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics) as a gift a while back, and finally got around to reading it.

As laid out by the title, this book differs a bit from Levitt and Dubner's previous books in that it sets out to teach the reader how to "think like a freak". Here is a short excerpt that explains what it means to think like a freak:

> We'd like to bury the idea that there's a right way and a wrong way, a smart way and a foolish way, a red way and a blue way. The modern world demands that we all think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally; that we think from a different angle, with a different set of muscles, with a different set of expectations; that we think with neither fear nor favor, with neither blind optimism nor sour skepticism. That we think like - ahem - a Freak.

Each chapter follows the same basic format. Through a series of stories (Levitt and Dubner later write that storytelling is a good method of persuasion), each chapter demonstrates a different quality of a "Freak".
